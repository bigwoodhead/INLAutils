New submission

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  INLA (3:30, 11:48, 12:54)
  ggplot (4:9, 12:19)

These words are spelled correctly.


Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
  INLA
  
This package is based around adding to the INLA package. I understand this package cannot be on CRAN.
